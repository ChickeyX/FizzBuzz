# FizzBuzz

## Description

This is an example of asymmetric cryptography in Python. It will allow you to encrypt a `.txt` file using the public key of the intended recipient, ensuring only they are able to decrypt it with their private key.

See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSIDS_lvRv4) video for an explaination of asymmetric cryptography.

## Usage

First install `cryptography` with: `pip3 install cryptography`

Download and run the script with:
```
git clone https://github.com/ChickeyX/Asymmetric-Cipher.git
cd ~/Asymmetric-Cipher
python3 cipher.py
```

The script is easy to use - you will be provided with instructions when you run the script.
